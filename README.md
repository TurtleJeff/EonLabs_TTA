# EonLabs_TTA

Python 3.9.10

I prepared two files for each TTA. The HTML files can be downloaded and opened in a web browser. The ipynb files can be viewed on GitHub and run with all the dependencies in requirements.txt

## Idea
1. Data Representation: abstractly, it's something similar to P(A) = P(A|B)\*P(B) in probability or a company issuing new shares... just maintain the consistency from yearly level to hourly level. 
2. Coding: 30 minutes: the first one was just to keep the last five elements in the input array w/o duplicates plus some formatting. the second one was that for each postion, the volumn of trapped water is decided by the highest wall to its left and the highest wall to its right.
3. Data Collection: this part is straightforward, the difficulty was that google limits the number of access. to solve the issue, I let the script wait for a short time if an error is encountered.

## Time
1. Data Representation: 1.5 hours
2. Coding: 30 minutes
3. Data Collection: 0.5 hours for development plus time for testing
